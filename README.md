# Stock Price Prediction for Microsoft

This project focuses on predicting the future stock prices of Microsoft based on historical data spanning four years. The goal is to forecast the stock prices for the next 90 days using machine learning models.

## Data

The dataset used for this project includes historical stock prices of Microsoft collected over the past four years. The data includes daily closing prices, volume, and other relevant features that are used for training the prediction models.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the features, and split into training and testing datasets.

### Model Selection

Several Deep learning models were considered and evaluated for their predictive performance. Models include but are not limited to:

- LSTM 

### Model Training

The selected models were trained on the training dataset and tuned using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to improve accuracy.

### Prediction

Once trained, the models were used to predict the stock prices for the next 90 days. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used to assess the performance of each model.

## Results

The predicted stock prices for the next 90 days are presented, along with visualizations comparing predicted versus actual prices.
